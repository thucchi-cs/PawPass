## Purpose and Use

### Who Can Use It

We built this app for pet shelters and individuals to keep track of their pets. Individuals might utilize this by attaching their pet's QR code on the collar, so if the pet gets lost, all necessary and vital information is there for whoever finds the pet. Pet shelters might also use this app to keep track and access information of their pets instantly.

### Why It Was Made

We made this after consulting with pet shelters volunteers about what they wish they could improve the most. They informed us they would love a system in which they can scan a QR code and it will pull up all the information about a pet. So, we expanded on that, and created a system that can be used both by shelters and owners.
