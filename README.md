## How to Use
First, create a QR Code via the Create QR Code button. Then input the information of your pet alongside a password, and click next. After that, you can download and print a QR code which stores the information you inputted. 

If you need to edit any information stored, you can click on the edit QR code button, input your password and pet ID, and change any information from there. The QR code will be automatically updated.

## Who It's For

We built this app for pet shelters and individuals to keep track of their pets. Individuals might also utilize this as a low cost solution to putting vital information on their pet collars, so if the pets get lost, the information is right there. 


## Why It Was Made

We made this after consolting with pet shelters volunteers about what they wish they could improve the most. They informed us they would love a system in which they can scan a QR code and it will pull up all the information about a pet. So, we improved on that, and created a system that can be used both by shelters and owners.
